# Yet Another Instagram Developer Guide by dani

## Attention! This is still a work in progress

All the following flags to enable could not work in some versions, and some others could make Instagram crash, if last case happens, clean data from de app and restart, the problem is that you will have to do everything again.
As an alternative you can check by @Fix Guide, and maybe find a solution

# Important

## Enable all features

```md
igd xac unbundle
```

Enables all settings for you even if your account is not eligible for these

## Remove Instagram analytic telemetry

```md
analytics2 consolidation max batch lock attempts
```

When this option is set to 0, the application prevents the creation of files in the "app_analytics" folder, which allows you to keep a correct size of the application.
<video height="auto" width="100%" autoplay loop src="https://github.com/daniiii5/assets/blob/main/media/634a233671cf3deded0c5.mp4" controls title="Title"></video>

## Remove annoying play store update dialog

```md
google play update api
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

# Quality

## Upload photos up to 1440p resolution in stories

```md
ensure 1440p photo upload
```

By default the photos you upload to stories are 1080, enabling this setting will increase the resolution up to 1440.
![Alt text](https://github.com/daniiii5/assets/blob/main/media/fc84589ad9d03c89b41a4.png)

## Reduce compression of photo uploads in the feed

```md
photo creation
```

70 = 30% compression
100 = 0% compression (without compression)
![Alt text](https://github.com/daniiii5/assets/blob/main/media/035e2b53ab91ab9b577b3.png)

## High quality video uploads on stories and reels

```md
high quality upload setting
```

Enter the name and enable the toggle and put the bitrate mbps to 20 (recommended).

You can change it to 20 if you use video with 1080p or 1440p resolution (for slightly better compression). And the maximum bitrate you can use is 30 (suitable for 4k video) but there is a possibility that the video will fail to upload if you use bitrate above 25Mbps so be careful.
![Alt text](https://github.com/daniiii5/assets/blob/main/media/5ffafb8221b9b6a6a0df9.png)

After enabling the setting restart the app, and then go to the Instagram settings > Account or Preferences > Cellular data use > and turn on the "Upload at highest quality" option.
